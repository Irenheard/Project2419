Required content is as follows:

Main landing page (aka upon arrival you see) content:
  Project title as submitted (and listed everywhere else)
  Your client's organization
  A short description of your project
  Optionally you may also include your project's abstract here
Final solution/deliverables/products section
  Links, screenshots, whatever works best for you
Team member information
  Optionally includes your contact information
A summary of your methodology
  This is not meant to be detailed (nobody is going to read a detailed methodology)
Formatting and style are completely up to you (separate pages, scrolling style, etc.). Keep it simple, and use tools and templates to make this a quick task - we don't recommend building from scratch.
